<p>
Data are 10 sec samples on a 1 Hz time base with identical timestamps to the most current RAF
1 Hz cdf data files (e.g. RF01.20081015.164800_201200.PNI.nc).  Data is represented
as repeated 1 Hz values for each 10 second interval.  Periodic sements of missing data (~1 min)
are from instrument background checks, usually at the beginning and end of each leg and more
frequently during profiles.
<p>
The instrument suffered from sensitivity issues and electronic malfunctions throughout the
project, and we were unable to ship spare parts into Chile to complete repairs.  Longer segments
of missing data are due to instrument malfunctions.  Nevertheless, we were able to make
measurements on all flights and the data will allow an assessment of the mean boundary layer
DMS concentrations, vertical and horizontal gradients, and rate of change with time.
<p>
Under meteorological conditions for VOCALS, the free tropospheric concentration of DMS was 
near zero pptv.  The detection limit on any given flight may therefore be assessed from the variance
for free trop measurements.  In general, the detection limit was better than 5 pptv.
