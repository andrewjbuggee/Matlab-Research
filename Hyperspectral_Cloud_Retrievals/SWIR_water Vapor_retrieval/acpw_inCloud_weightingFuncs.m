% Producing Albert et al.'s (2001) weighting functions in cloud for water
% vapor

% By Andrew John Buggee

% Weighting functions are defined using ratios of reflectance in two bands,
% one within a water vapor absorption feature, and one outside

% R = the reflectance ratio
% R_j = the transmittance over a thin layer that contains water vapor
